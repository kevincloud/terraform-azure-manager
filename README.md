# Sentinel Data Manager - Azure

Hashicorp Sentinel provides the ability to make your policy-as-code more dynamic using the HTTP request module. This demo allows you to show how easy it is to pull dynamic data into Sentinel for process at "run-time." As soon as a run is started, the policies are read in, then executed during the policy stage.

__NOTE: It's important to understand that the nature of this demo is to simplify a complex workflow, which inherently means setting it up will be a little more involved first time around. But once you've finished setting it up the first time, it'll be quite simple to rinse and repeat the actual demo portion.__
